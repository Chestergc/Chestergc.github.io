<blockquote>
<p>In my head, I see you all over me. You fulfill my fantasies. It&#39;s going down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, How are you? I&#39;m dead inside. Fuck me right?</p>
<p>I miss you, you know that right? There is a good reason for me to not speak.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that I hate you, or anything, I just. Yeah. Fuck this. I love you.</p>
<p>In my head, I can see we talking again like we used to. Like life used to let us. Like all things used to happen. I think that sometimes I just think that to make myself feel better.</p>
<p>We&#39;re so fucking different. I wanted different, totally my fault, again.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>And I can&#39;t come out of this on top. At all.</p>
<p>You know all those shits I didn&#39;t give about life and the world? How I completely ignored the universe? And how I screamed a huge fuckit to everything in my life? They all ended up in you.</p>
<p>I seem to give more of a thought about every single word I say to you than I do to every living moment I have in my life right now.</p>
<p>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?</p>
<p>WHY CAN&#39;T I THINK LIKE I USED TO?</p>
<p>WHY THE HELL CAN&#39;T I BE LIKE I USED TO?</p>
<p>Would you be able to guess who is drunk?</p>
<p>Hah.</p>
<p>I suppose that&#39;s nothing new by now.</p>
<p>Baby I want out. Just thought you should know.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>And I see. She is long gone. And I realise the joke is on me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sorry. I love you. Hope you live a good life.</p>
