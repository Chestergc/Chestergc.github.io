      <p>While you could start with either side, if the core is low prime with the physical half, it has sturdier grips. (CGP Grey on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck">Spaceship You</a>)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Half a year later I finally feel like I can talk about this video without it feeling ungenuine or weird. As most people would know I&#39;m not the most exercise happy person in the world. I&#39;m a lazy twenty something, it&#39;s expected from the character, so I&#39;ve just never cared enough to see if there was something I wanted to do that was vaguely physical.</p>
      <p>Then the pandemic hit. It&#39;s actually quite funny to think that the cyberpunk distopia is what drove me into exercising but it really did. I&#39;ve never enjoyed leaving my home anyways, but that was an option I liked to have open to me, if it gets too hard I could just hop on the bike and vanish for a couple hours. Always did that. And the moment I couldn&#39;t anymore my head took the brunt of it.</p>
      <p>It was quite hard to start. When you&#39;re sad enough to need a psychiatrist there is a lot of inertia into keeping you in the same place you already are. After I was done with the video it seemed to spark the will to do it, but the body couldn&#39;t follow because of that weighty inertia that seemed to permeate my whole house. </p>
      <p>I started quite slow to be honest, set up an exercise bike in a room I didn&#39;t use, drew lines in my bedroom between my bed and my computer, set up the workshop downstairs to work in. It took me weeks to do that, but it worked. </p>
      <p>Every time I entered my &quot;exercise&quot; room I exercised. I started with 10 minutes of cycling a day, (Which was a lot coming from me), a few weeks later I downloaded one of those body weight exercises app (the one from Nike if you guys care about it) and started doing it daily, even on the days I couldn&#39;t wake up, when my head got the better of me and I slept through the day. </p>
      <p>The thing that actually helped was the delimitation of space, every time I got into that space I exercised, whether or not I wanted, whether or not I had the power to(and believe you me i didn&#39;t most of the time. Some people have those &quot;I don&#39;t wanna run&quot; days, I had whole weeks like that).</p>
      <p>Then after that I bought training weights, just a couple to start with, 6kg ones, but I had got to the point where pushups did nothing for me anymore so it was kinda necessary. </p>
      <p>It&#39;s quite amazing to think that just a couple of training weights could change anything, but it really did. I was finishing most exercise routines dripping with sweat again and actually feeling good about it instead of like shit as usual. </p>
      <p>The rest of the day I did feel like shit, anxiety and such, but that one point in the day I actually felt ok. Not great, just ok. And that made me realise that I set the bar way too high for most things. Having got into the habit of talking to no one for whole weeks I shut myself out of society, trying to keep to myself to avoid hurting or being hurt. </p>
      <p>But I really didn&#39;t need to. Not every conversation has to be the best written script since hereditary, and not every interaction has to leave you wanting more. You could just keep doing it for a while and see how you feel about a person.</p>
      <p>And so I did. I opened up quite a bit. I&#39;ve started making friends again for the first time since I-don&#39;t-even-know-when, and I&#39;m doing better. At least not dreading the possibility of being part of another social interaction as I used to. I even have online friends I care about, which is a new feeling to say the least. </p>
      <p>I don&#39;t mean to say that is for everyone, it most likely is not, but most people should at least try. </p>
      <p>I&#39;ve always been pretty skeptical about the whole &quot;exercising releases serotonin&quot; thing that most people talk about, I mostly just felt like shit the whole time and after it. There are days that I still do, but for different reasons.</p>
      <p>It&#39;s quite rewarding to notice how you are getting better, I&#39;ve never been able to do a pushup, now I can do 20 at a time. The exercising part actually does release copious amounts of &quot;the happy chemical&quot; in your head, you just don&#39;t notice it because you&#39;re using the whole thing to exercise. The one thing that made me realise what people were talking about was yoga.</p>
      <p>The nike app has a few yoga routines, quite simple easy ones that you&#39;re supposed to do by yourself listening to nothing besides the instructor. The first few minutes are a pain, boring stretching exercises, &quot;the downward facing dog&quot; and other stuff that you&#39;d only hear about in a sitcom or in an actual class, then a few minutes later it clicks.</p>
      <p>You start treating it as a challenge to yourself and trying to do everything as well as you can and you start sweating a lot without noticing because you&#39;re focused on the exercise and at the end you are just laid down on the mat trying to think about how people work and why the hell is everyone ok with being organic, it is so hard to maintain the damn body you&#39;ve been born with, your mind running at 200 kilometers an hour and then you stop. </p>
      <p>Everything goes quiet, you can feel your heavy breathing all the sweat pooling around your mat, the weight of the air pressure in your body, every breath being delibeate and lighting up a series of connections in your head that lead nowhere just to pretend you&#39;re still alive. And then you&#39;re just happy you&#39;ve done it. </p>
      <p>It is the weirdest thing in the world, how hormones control every thought you have even without you knowing about them. Or how they work. </p>
      <p>It&#39;s one of those experiences that you could spend weeks trying to fumble together words to describe moderately well but it wouldn&#39;t say anything to a person that doesn&#39;t already know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>
      <p>After that experience I&#39;ve started looking for things I enjoyed for myself for the first time in a while. I started boxing, just by myself at home, without a punching bag or anything, then I moved to Thay Boxing, which is so much fun it hurts. It always gets me that experience, but very differently because of the power you&#39;re supposed to invest into every movement. </p>
      <p>Yoga gets you the experience through control and timing, Muay Thay gets you the same experience through power and exaustion. I never knew that was a thing that actually happened, but it makes perfect sense now how fight rounds are 3 minutes tops, I&#39;d probably die if I tried to go over that. </p>
      <p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m perfectly happy now, far from it, but I&#39;m way better that I was. I still feel like shit most of the time and although I mostly have good reasons to feel like that I now have moments that I feel happy as well. And to be honest that is the best anyone could hope for.</p>
