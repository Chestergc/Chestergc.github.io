      <h1 id="laziness-the-inspiration-machine">Laziness - The inspiration Machine</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The greatest achievement of human existence will always be the lengths people will go to not need to do something.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>People actually complain of being bored quite often, whether or not they realize it boredom itself is quite a motivator. The amount of creativity employed by people to stave off boredom is quite impressive.</p>
    <p>We were bored in the forests, so we invented tools to draw on walls while we weren't hungry, we were bored at the farms, so we invented machines that could do our job while we played with cards or something.</p>
    <p>We were bored at work so we created robots to do our job.</p>
    <p>That is a good thing at all available schools of thought. By making so that humans have less work to do we make sure that humans are applied to the more important jobs that actually require them, such as designing new better robots or new and interesting way to not do something.</p>
    <p>But people are afraid of change, any change actually takes a long time to implement because most people are against it. "We have always done it like this, why would we change?"</p>
    <p>It's one of the main problems with humankind to be honest. Right now, with the way we do engineering and robotics we could actually be past the need for societies and centralized production/distribution systems, but everyone is very much against not working.</p>
    <p>It's a very big problem, because it's not something new, it's the culmination of a trend that has been going since the industrial revolution. Every new generation has less and less people producing food for a greater and greater number of people.</p>
    <p>It's never shown any signs of stopping or even slowing down but still people frown at the idea of producing and distributing food without the need for human interaction with the system in place. It's just always been like that, we work to acquire money to exchange for food and basic necessities.</p>
    <p>I know I have hit quite hard on that key all my life and most people don't even pay attention to me anymore, but that doesn't make it any less important.</p>
    <p>There will be a moment in evolution where we won't really need to work for the basic needs anymore, and then what should we do?</p>
    <p>I say give in to the laziness.</p>
    <p>Just stop working and make something you actually properly love for a change. We could actually sustain the whole world population by the use of distributed production systems, completely negating the need for distribution and transportation. Especially if we start thinking about the minimum necessary space a person needs as being enough to implant such a system.</p>
    <p>The idea itself is simple, taking only a few steps to execute;</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Designate necessary land to the number of individuals living off of it (Estimate it roughly as 0,3 kilometers squared per person).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Develop self sustaining sun or wind based power systems(At small proportions, just to kick in the computational servers, if you can use fusion energy that is the way to go).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Implement a computational server to look after the necessities and production (It would need to be pre produced at this point, although you could skip this step if you're confident enough in the people's capability to produce it later using the GPR/ASR systems).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Implement general purpose robots to kick off the production and develop Application Specific Robots(ASRs) for water treatment, agriculture and machine production.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Generate resources from available land.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Produce settlements with the resources generated.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move a population to the settlement just produced until the place haves the necessary number of people in it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If there are more people that need it, locate and measure available nearby land and repeat.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Given the radius of earth as something around 63000 kilometers we can calculate it's surface area as four times pi multiplied by the radius squared, giving us a little over 510 million square miles, making earth viable in theory for a population of a little over 1 trillion people, although in reality that number would be a bit smaller due to the necessities of heat dissipation of such a population's radiation.</p>
    <p>It may seem like it would take time, but given the simplicity of the first steps you could technically have a million systems running at the same time, making sure that you can accommodate the whole human population in a couple decades at most.</p>
    <p>This system only works on small societies, comprised of at most a thousand individuals per settlement, otherwise the self sufficient distributed production system stops making sense.</p>
    <p>The thing that makes this work properly is that it is not human dependent. Theoretically the system runs itself. You could pack it into a space ship and launch it into another planet and it would work just as well. Specially if you could make use of particle accelerators for raw material production, since power is way easier to generate than any other resource.</p>
    <p>With fusion power systems the whole process would be so negligible in terms of cost that it would not even be taken into consideration the material you would need to bring, since a fusion powered accelerator could create virtually anything given the place you're trying to colonize has at least some useful molecules, such as hydrogen, helium, carbon and so on.</p>
    <p>The society I see developing from these kinds of schemes would be fundamentally different from our current government models. Products no longer have any cost, the important thing to these societies is data. Creating an economy based solely on intellectual properties.</p>
    <p>If you need something, all you require to have it is a decent blueprint, or even just an AI that can develop it for you. One of the best examples of the power of these kinds of systems comes, as always, from science fiction.</p>
    <p>In the universe of Warhammer 40k we had developed such a system, in the early 20000s we had what the universe lore calls STCs, they were pretty much Artificial Intelligences with development capability and integrated basic production systems, such as the here proposed GPRs for initial production.</p>
    <p>In the period known as the Stellar Exodus humans loaded such systems into ships and flew them away from the solar system, colonizing most of the galaxy at that point with little to no resistance. The STC could produce anything they needed, be it defensive technology, terraforming tools, production systems, anything a colony may need.</p>
    <p>It seems a bit far fetched to have computers developing systems, but we are already seeing the start of this, with the current designs for fusion generators being completely computer designed to have the best possible magnetic performance based on the mathematics we currently have.</p>
    <p>It's not hard for an automation engineer to imagine a computer developing parts of a system, given the right instruction set it's even possible to imagine a current computer developing a whole system by combining some base designs with deep learning algorithms for part optimization.</p>
    <p>The point i'm trying to make is that laziness got us to the point where humans are not required to work to be able to live, we could try to stop it, delay the inevitable, but eventually technology always wins, and we can either embrace it now and make the world a better place for the living, or let it take a couple thousand years and endure the suffering for the time it takes.</p>
