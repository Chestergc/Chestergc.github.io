      <h1>Choice -- The Discrimination Machine</h1>
<h2>or how to ruin your whole life in a single bad call.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose the right job and you'll never work a day in your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as of late I have been stricken with a complete disregard for everything that ever existed in the universe on the account of my brain finally figuring out that i'm old as all hell as soon as young people started coming to me for advice. Christ I totally get the cynicism that comes with age, it has a lot to do with not being able to tell what the kids like these days and unremarkably shitting all over it like a constipated whore after anal sex with a whole football team.</p>
<p>On other related news, I really enjoy robotics engineering, hence it's what people ask me about, young people come up to me yelling at the top of their lungs that they know shit about the world and all of a sudden i'm supposed to give two tugs on their flaccid genitalia and explain how life works. Here's the headline: "I DON'T".</p>
<p>I can tell you how it goes, yes, but I don't know shit about it. So, in the interest of not having to answer this stupid question again I'm going to sum up the best bits and you can read this post and stop harassing me like a two year old that haven't eaten in three hours.</p>
<p>It usually starts off pretty casually, with a unremarkable highschool that doesn't push you enough and a craving for something that actually makes sense, it never does if you're wondering, then you enroll in some course about mechatronics and all of a sudden your eyes glisten like it's christmas for a whole month.</p>
<p>It pulls you in with the promise of making all those robots in Metal Gear come true, because we can do it and we're pretty good at it, but no one cares about making a dog with a sniper rifle strapped to it's back.</p>
<p>And then before you realize, you are bored out of your skull.</p>
<p>Industrial mechatronics is one of those things that looks completely amazing from afar, but as soon as you poke your nose close enough to smell it you realize it always smells like a sweaty armpit with delusions of being shaven in the next twenty five years.</p>
<p>It's an industry lost in it's own arse for so long that they really could not be bothered to look out the window for a couple seconds and let me do the amazing things other people are doing. If you know how to plug a potentiometer on a protoboard(tip, insert the pointy bits into the holes) you know how to do anything a company may ask of you.</p>
<p>It's one of those amazing cases of being able to do something and sticking to it so hard that when you try to get up from your computer chair you realize that the chair is already shaped like your ass from prolonged use.</p>
<p>Maybe i'm bitter from having to swallow people calling LADDER diagrams and Grafcet flowcharts "Programming", what the fucking hell is wrong with people? It couldn't be further from a programming language if it was stuck to a 1930's tractor in Russia, but I digress.</p>
<p>The point is that the "Industry" figured out that electrical engineers are the closest equivalent to computer engineers and the best they can do is avoid computer people like the plague by contriving stupid bullshit reasons to let the electricians do the programming of their ridiculously redundant machines.</p>
<p>And that has been it for as long as anyone can remember, someone comes up with a good idea, like servos or transistors, and for the next twenty or so years other people find ways to make using said technologies as stupidly contrived as possible, so they don't run the risk of someone actually coming up with a clever use for the technologies.</p>
<p>I'm from Brasil, so maybe I'm a bit biased when it comes to it, but the bulk of my work is not on making machines work, but instead in coming up with clever ways of applying bullshit security systems and counterfeit measures so that the stupid assholes operating my machines don't lose a fucking arm being stupid and blame me for it.</p>
<p>It's the influence of the internet culture, i'm sure of it. Eight people sitting around a room jerking off their respectively gendered genitalia and laughing at the guys that started up with a clever idea and some soul. Because obviously soul has nothing to do with being clever so let's laugh and point at the guy with the ideas while we drown on a puddle of semen and piss handed down to us from the gods of middle management.</p>
<p>The point being that Mechatronics is a carpet of semen sitting comfortably below a shiny giant robot and I wouldn't give it up for all the coked up sex in the world. Unless that coked up sex involves eight people and a nine figure retirement plan.</p>
