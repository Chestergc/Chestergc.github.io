<p>Mathematicians have a beautiful way to think about things.</p>
<p>In short: &quot;Anything that has already been done is trivial, everything that hasn&#39;t been done yet may be undecidable&quot;.</p>
<p>That is a consequence of the so called Axioms, all of them are really well thought out and for most of the time they behave perfectly naturally, as one might expect.</p>
<p>And other times. Not so much.</p>
<p>Which is the problem with abstraction, you get to a level that the rules are so simple that they actually seem to be perfect, and you poke at them with a ten feet ruler and figure out that they break on pretty much every turn.</p>
<p>The rules of modern mathematics, as most would agree, are the so called axioms of set theory, a theory where every mathematical function is formalizable under itself. And from that the problems arise.</p>
<p>One of the first consequences of the axioms to gain public attention was the incompleteness theorems. It&#39;s a thought experiment, and pretty simple one at that, that raises some amazing questions about the way we think about life. For this portion I will quote Wolfram Alpha, as I am not qualified to explain it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory which include Peano arithmetic include undecidable propositions.</p>
<p>No consistent axiomatic system which includes Peano arithmetic can prove its own consistency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first theorem, states that any theory, doesn&#39;t matter how complex, can be either consistent or complete, but not both. Essentially meaning that, any system, based on any concept can only ever hope to be incomplete. As you may reasonably assume, a inconsistent system is useless.</p>
<p>The second theorem is where the heads roll and existential crisis begins, it states that any system, based on any concept, doesn&#39;t matter how complete it looks or how in depth it&#39;s statements, cannot prove it&#39;s consistency.</p>
<p>Essentially, a system that is complete cannot prove it&#39;s complete, and a system that is inconsistent has a statement about it&#39;s completeness derivable from it&#39;s axioms.</p>
<p>The dangers of abstraction, it&#39;s already hard enough to come up with a system, and to know that if the system can prove it&#39;s complete means that it&#39;s inconsistent can be a soul crushing revelation. There are countless stories about situations such as these, a mathematician thinking about a problem for decades and getting nowhere, hearing about the completeness theorems and going insane from the doubt.</p>
<p>What if this problem i&#39;m working on is not provable from the axioms? What do I do if this is true? It seems to be true, I can see it working, why can&#39;t I prove it? Mathematics has to be consistent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the universe doesn&#39;t care about your existential crisis. It&#39;s wonderful to be able to prove stuff, but whether or not you prove it, stuff will keep happening.</p>
<p>And I know what you&#39;re thinking right now, &quot;But does it generalize?&quot;, okay, I know you weren&#39;t thinking about that, I was, and the paper seems to follow my train of thought so we will use it.</p>
<p>The answer is: Maybe. We don&#39;t know. We can&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Quite a number of problems in life sit in that category, undecidable, unprovable, unformalizable. That is what they don&#39;t tell you in school, you grow up thinking that life will answer your questions, you grow cocky through your teenage years and then you get hit with a shovel on the side of the head when you find your first real problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A problem worthy of attack proves it&#39;s worth by fighting back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like a well choreographed dance between lovers. You take his hand, you know how to move, but can he move with you? You can only hope that he knows where you will be and moves accordingly, there is quite a level of uncertainty in it, but you believe him nonetheless.</p>
<p>In my search for answers I could only come up with questions. In my search for completeness I found inconsistency. In my search for love, I found emptiness.</p>
<p>Much like the doctor, I am at the end of a road, trying to decide if I should turn back or move on through uncharted lands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like it here. This place where time and space seem to switch places and every road points to the same spot. That&#39;s why I must leave, it doesn&#39;t scare me anymore.</p>
