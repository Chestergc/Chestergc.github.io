<blockquote>
<p>People intrigue me, just not enough to make me like them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about the way people usually assume I am this past week. I guess being away from everyone kind of surprised me, I never thought I could miss the amount of useless things that exist in the world, but here I am, thinking about people and their perception of me.</p>
<p>In any case, People that actually know me must have seen the picture of me in the beach, hiding from the sun in my boots and long sleeved shirt, that was the way I felt comfortable. And apparently people thought it was funny.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong though, I know why people thought it was funny, I just didn't think anyone would pay attention to it. The post was entitled "Images of pain and suffering: A goth in the beach", and that got me thinking, do people think I'm a goth?</p>
<p>I mean, I know a few goths, and safe from a couple of very close friends tugging my balls virtually none of them think of me as a goth. I don't think of myself as a goth. It's cool if people actually want to think I'm a goth, but my place is not in the crypts, although I really enjoy a nice glass of wine by the graveyard on occasion.</p>
<p>I'm a cyberpunk. A techwear enthusiast. A Technophile in every sense of the word. One of those people that would be fine replacing every limb in their body and then some if given the opportunity. And that's what I thought people saw me as. With the over-the-top 80's shirts, the neon aesthetic I use in everything, even the (now dead) NINPunk movement I used to style me comics back in the day.</p>
<p>I should write about that someday, how NINPunk worked, and what was the idea behind it. Although there wasn't much thought put into it.</p>
<p>I know that most people don't do it on purpose, I actually think that no one does it on purpose, but it still always get to me in another level. Like if someone you know dearly all of a sudden decided to say you were "different". It doesn't really change anything but the perception you have of other people's perception. And I hate it.</p>
<p>It's one of those useless arguments you have with people on the internet. "You can't be this, you don't do that".</p>
<p>It never amounts to anything, but it kind of hurts, because you thought people were welcoming and accepting of new people in their circles, but they are not. And in the circle I want to be there are very few people, most of which know nothing about actual robotics, clothes or cyberpunk for that matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introductory line of Danielewsky's opus never fit so well in any situation as it does now. The thing that gets me sad is that for the most part I actually do put in the effort. I've been a hipster for as far as I can remember, appropriating other cultures and dress codes "because they look cool", and this is the first time I've took the conscious decision to adhere to a single movement and make it mine.</p>
<p>And it apparently only works when there are other people that actually do it.</p>
<p>It doesn't change anything though. Every person alive has had an identity crisis at least once in their life, and I'm certain that this is how I choose to be for now. Even if no on likes it, if no one understands it, that is their problem, I've got nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>I've called myself a lot of things, but the current definition is the one that made me laugh out loud and throw the whole concept out of the window. Pansexual Alcoholic Technophile. As if those words actually meant anything. I actually stand by that definition, but definitions in of itself are flawed. They do not capture a person, they do not define a personality, although we are used to think it does.</p>
<p>For what is worth, may it be here noted that I'm me. The words used to describe me may change, may be perverted, may be misused but I am ME, and no amalgamation of crudely construed words will ever capture that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a place where you are free to be anything. Because no one is expecting nothing from you. And that is perfect.</p>
